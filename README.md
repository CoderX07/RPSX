# RPSX
Ah yes. Rock, Paper, Scissors!  A childhood classic.  Let me present (my retro new version): RPSX!!  Basically, it's rock, paper, scissors coded in Python. There is also a random choice, where the computer basically chooses rock/paper/scissors randomly. The code is NOT CASE SENSITIVE!  If you don't know how to play Rock, Paper, Scissors click the link below: https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors  (Only Step 4 Applies - I hardcoded the other steps)  That's all! Hope you enjoy!!  CoderX07
